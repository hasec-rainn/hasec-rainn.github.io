This is done by preprocessing images of receipts, scanning them with Tesseract OCR, and storing them in a csv file that can then be read into a SQL database. Analysis is then performed with an SQL database to provide insights into the user's spending habits.<br><br> See the project <a href='https://github.com/hasec-rainn/Saving_Sergeant'><u>here</u></a> on github."

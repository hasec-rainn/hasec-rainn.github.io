    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        Hey there, my name is Chase Nairn-Howard; I'm a recent Computer Science
        graduate from Oregon State University. My two internships at KTM Research
        and ClimateSteps, in addition to my personal projects, have given me the
        skills needed to build databases, use machine learning, and develop and
        maintain websites.

        I'm more than just my internships, however. 
        I've ventured into the heart of the Mexican Jungle to aid biologists' research,
        presented to the California Board of Forestry, and have been trusted to provide
        care to those in their final days as a hospice caregiver.
